# CodeBuild LOCAL installation instructions:
# Both 'docker' and 'git' MUST be installed before you proceed!
#
# Clone the 'aws-codebuild-docker-images repository'
#
        git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images.git
        cd aws-codebuild-docker-images/ubuntu/standard/6.0
#
# Edit 'aws-codebuild-docker-images/ubuntu/standard/6.0/Dockerfile'
# Use an editor of your choice to remove the last line which
# contains ( ENTRYPOINT [“dockerd-entrypoint.sh”] ) and save the file.
# Build a 5.7GB docker image in about 11 minutes:
#
        docker build -t aws/codebuild/standard:6.0 .
#
# Setup LOCAL CodeBuild agent using the LATEST version
# NOTE - Subscribe for email notification when a version becomes available.
#
        docker pull \
        amazon/aws-codebuild-local:latest --disable-content-trust=false
#
# There is NO need to do anything with script 'codebuild_build.sh'.
# Some have advised replacing it but since the one provided works as it
# should and already has appropriate permissions, it should not be touched.
#
# Details of build script execution:
#
# Execute a 'buildspec.yml' file.
# Change ownership from root back to whoever executed this script.
# This will require 'sudo' and appropriate permissions.
# By default, root will own the output directory and its contents.
# This gets annoying when a non-root user wants to access, modify or
# delete the directory and/or its contents.
# Clean up docker litter ( Stopped Containers )
# Creating/Removing directory './TimeWaster'commands were included to
# ensure that directory
# 'aws-codebuild-docker-images/ubuntu/standard/6.0/local-builds'
# gets a more recent datetime stamp than directory 
# 'aws-codebuild-docker-images/ubuntu/standard/6.0/local-builds/output'
#
# Open a command shell.
# Navigate to directory:
# 'aws-codebuild-docker-images/ubuntu/standard/6.0/local-builds'.
# Copy buildspec.yml file 'baby-buildspec.yml' to .
# Copy/paste the commands between the asterisks into the command shell.
# Find output artifacts in file:
# 'aws-codebuild-docker-images/ubuntu/standard/6.0/local-builds/output/artifacts.zip'.
